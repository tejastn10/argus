Argus is a lightweight and efficient uptime monitoring service written in Go. It periodically checks the availability and response time of a given URL and logs the results. Designed with simplicity, reliability, and extensibility in mind, Argus is a great starting point for developers looking to monitor service health.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Periodic URL monitoring
- ‚úÖ Response time measurement
- ‚úÖ Logs URL status (up or down) with error details
- ‚úÖ Customizable monitoring intervals
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and fast
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend and deploy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control (optional).
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment.

---

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/argus.git
    cd argus
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

---

### Usage

1. Update the `main.go` file with the URL and monitoring interval:

    ```go
    url := "https://example.com"
    interval := 30 * time.Second
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```bash
    go build -o argus
    ```

3. Execute the binary:

    ```bash
    ./argus
    ```

4. Argus will start monitoring the specified URL and log the status, response time, and errors (if any).

### Example Output

```md
Starting uptime monitoring for <https://example.com> every 30s
URL: <https://example.com> | Status: true | Response Time: 102ms
URL: <https://example.com> | Status: false | Error: dial tcp: lookup example.com: no such host
